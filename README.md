## 📖 About the Tool

Selecting groups, pairs, or individuals isn’t always easy – and often not fair.  
**R&B** provides a playful and engaging way to make random selections.  



## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Choose whether to select **one person** or form **two teams**.
2. All participants tap **one finger on the screen** and remember their colour.  
3. After a few seconds, the random choice will be displayed. 

> 🔎 Note: The maximum number of fingers are 15.



## 🎓 Classroom Use Cases

- Fairly choose a student to answer a question.  
- Create pairs or teams quickly, without arguments.  
- Assign tasks or extra nightshifts randomly.  
- Randomly pick presentation topics or project ideas.  

This tool ensures variety, fairness, and boosts attention.  
Even quieter students get the chance to be selected – without the need to raise hands.
